## About

##### What is the most vulnerable thing? People. And people make stupid passwords. A weak password can be one that is easily guessed by someone profiling the user, such as their birthday, nickname, address, name of a pet or relative, or a common word such as God, love, money or password.

##### That is why TenGen was made, and it can be used in situations like legal penetration tests or forensic crime investigations.
